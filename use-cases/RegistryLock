Registry Lock is a security feature implemented by CIRA within their Fury Oracle-based system  to help .ca registrants mitigate the risk of ‘domain name hijacking’.

Other countries have similar products in place. In Singapore, .SG registrants can use their Singpass digital identity application in order to access the SG Registry Lock Portal to enable/disable their domains. See here:

SingPass federates the log in function into SGnic. 

Rather than federating a log in function, CIRA would be looking to leverage digital credentials for the same function. A registrant that holds both  ‘Verified Person’ and  ‘Verified .CA Domain’ digital credentials can use these as proofs to enter the system and enable/disable their domain
